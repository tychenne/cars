```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

This is my first published github page as a learning example.

The dataset I used is called `mtcars`, which is part of the `datasets` package that comes with the base R installation.

Feel free to click on the different links on the navigation bar to view plots of different variables of the mtcars dataset plotted against each other.


```{r cars}
dim(mtcars)
head(mtcars, 5)
```

We can see that there are 32 vehicles each with 11 variables taken.
