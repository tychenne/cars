title: "Speed vs. Power"
---

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

Here I plot the `hp` variable against the `qsec` variable, which is the gross horsepower and $1/4$ mile time per vehicle respectively. I hypothesize that there is a _negative_ correlation between horsepower and quarter mile time because intuitively more power generates faster speeds.  

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
library(datasets)
ggplot(data = mtcars, aes(x = hp, y = qsec)) +
            geom_point(aes(colour = factor(cyl)))
```

Indeed that appears to be the case. I also colour separated different cylinder classes (cylinder is the chamber where the gasoline is burned and turned into power).
